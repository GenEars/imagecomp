# ImageComp
Many photographers, many devices, many files ... leads to have duplicates and loose time to manage this.
Following the need to simplify the reconciliation, sort and selection tasks about phototh√®que management, I decided to start this toy framework.

## Development project
Must have,
* [ ] Recursive exploration of directories
* [ ] Perceptual Hash computing of images
* [ ] Listing of files in manageable syntaxe (p.ex. XML)

Nice to have,
* [ ] Exif of files,
* [ ] Automatic tagging of files with content recognition,
* [ ] Geographical computation (enrichment with city name, zone clustering)
* [ ] Time frames computation (see Allen algebra for event logic),
* [ ] GUI for interactive management of this features.

## Notes

## Dependencies
Python,
* Call `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Anaconda
Use `pip install` from conda prompt.
